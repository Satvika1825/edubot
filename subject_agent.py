Here's a more detailed explanation:
Key Components:
- Constants: These are fixed numerical values, like 3, -5, or 1/2.
- Variables: These are symbols (usually letters) that represent unknown or changing values.
- Operations: These are the mathematical actions that connect constants and variables, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (ร or implied), and division (รท or /).

Examples:
- 5x + 2: This expression includes the variable x, the constant 2, and the operations of multiplication (by 5) and addition.
- 3y - 7: This expression involves the variable y, the constant 7, and operations of multiplication (by 3) and subtraction.
- 4xy + 2x - 5: This expression has two variables, x and y, constants 4, 2, and -5, and the operations of multiplication and addition/subtraction.
- (a + b) / c: This expression includes variables a, b, and c, and operations of addition and division.
